The 13th international workshop on Spin Caloritronics will be held in Beijing in May 20-24, 2024. Spin Caloritronics XIII will be co-organized by [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences](https://kits.ucas.ac.cn/) (UCAS) and Department of Physics, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). The workshop will be physically held in the KITS campus in Beijing. 

This workshop marks the 13th edition of the Spin Caloritronics series, which had successful iterations in

and Tsukuba ([2023](http://magmatelab.imr.tohoku.ac.jp/SpinCalori12-main.html)).	

# Scope

Spin caloritronics encompasses the study of coupled spin, charge, and heat transport in condensed materials and devices. As a multidisciplinary field that intersects with spintronics, thermoelectrics, optics, mechanics, and information science, it explores the fascinating connections between these domains.
