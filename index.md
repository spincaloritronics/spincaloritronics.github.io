The 13th international workshop on Spin Caloritronics will be held in Beijing in May 20-24, 2024. Spin Caloritronics XIII will be co-organized by [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences](https://kits.ucas.ac.cn/) (UCAS) and [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn).

# Scope

Spin caloritronics is the science and technology of coupled spin, charge, and heat transport in condensed matter and devices, a multidisciplinary discipline that emerged from common interests in spintronics and thermoelectrics and that overlaps with other fields such as optics, mechanics, and information science.

The Spin Caloritornics workshops had been previously held in 
Leiden ([2009](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/spin-caloritronics.html), [2011](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/spin-caloritronics-iii.html)), 
Sendai (2010, 2012), 
Columbus (2013, [2018](https://cem.osu.edu/news/spin-cal-ix/)), 
Irsee (2014), 
[Utrecht](https://web.science.uu.nl/spincaloritronics7/introduction.htm) (2016), 
Regensburg (2017), 
Groningen (2019), 
[Urbana-Champaign](https://cem.osu.edu/2022-workshop-spin-caloritronics-xi/) (2022), 
[Tsukuba](http://magmatelab.imr.tohoku.ac.jp/SpinCalori12-main.html) (2023).
