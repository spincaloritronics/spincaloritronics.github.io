The 13th international workshop on Spin Caloritronics will be held in Beijing in May 20-24, 2024. Spin Caloritronics XIII will be co-organized by 
[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences](https://kits.ucas.ac.cn/) (UCAS) and 
Department of Physics, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). 
The workshop will be physically held in the KITS campus in Beijing.

This workshop marks the 13th edition of the Spin Caloritronics series, which had successful iterations in
Leiden ([2009](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/spin-caloritronics.html), [2011](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/spin-caloritronics-iii.html)),
Sendai (2010, 2012),
Columbus ([2013](https://cem.osu.edu/event/spin-caloritronics-v/), [2018](https://cem.osu.edu/news/spin-cal-ix/)),
Irsee (2014),
Utrecht ([2016](https://web.science.uu.nl/spincaloritronics7/introduction.htm)),
Regensburg (2017),
Groningen (2019),
Urbana-Champaign ([2022](https://cem.osu.edu/2022-workshop-spin-caloritronics-xi/)),
and Tsukuba ([2023](http://magmatelab.imr.tohoku.ac.jp/SpinCalori12-main.html)).

All presentations will be by invitation only. We urge all researchers to participate in the workshop via poster presentations. If you wish to attend the workshop, please visit the [Application section](#application) below to submit your application.

## Scope

Spin caloritronics encompasses the study of coupled spin, charge, and heat transport in condensed materials and devices. As a multidisciplinary field that intersects with spintronics, thermoelectrics, optics, mechanics, and information science, it explores the fascinating connections between these domains.
