# Scope

Spin caloritronics encompasses the study of coupled spin, charge, and heat transport in condensed materials and devices. As a multidisciplinary field that intersects with spintronics, thermoelectrics, optics, mechanics, and information science, it explores the fascinating connections between these domains.
